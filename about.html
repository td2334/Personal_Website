          <h2>Professional Background</h2>
          <p>
          I’m a cybersecurity and IT systems professional with a strong technical foundation and a passion for infrastructure, security, and education. 
          I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity from Rochester Institute of Technology and an Associate degree in Information Technology from Finger Lakes Community College. 
          I'm currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I serve as an IT Support Technician II at Edutech BOCES. Since October 2022, I’ve supported multiple school districts across the region. 
          I spent three days a week at Dundee Central School District and two days a week at Mount Morris Central School District. 
          In March 2023, I transitioned from Mount Morris Central School District to supporting Geneva Central School District two days a week, where I advised the Technology Director on systems administration and cybersecurity strategy.
          As of July 1, 2025, I began serving full-time as the on-site technician for Finger Lakes Technical and Career Center, managing all day-to-day IT operations independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my work at EduTech, I serve as an Adjunct Instructor at Finger Lakes Community College, where I teach CSC-272 (Linux) and CSC-273 (Ethical Hacking).
          Beginning in Spring 2026, I am scheduled to teach CSC-153 (Introduction to Cloud Computing) as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m constantly sharpening my skills and staying current with the latest in the field. 
          My recent focus has been on Cloud Service Providers such as AWS and Azure—I maintain production servers on AWS and operate a penetration testing lab hosted in Azure. 
          I’m also active on platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box, where I regularly complete challenges to improve my offensive security capabilities.

        Provides insight into his work style and what drives him professionally
        -->
        <section class="about-section">
          <h2>Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            I believe in doing things the right way—with focus, clarity, and a strong sense of responsibility. My work style is hands-on, practical, and results-driven. 
            Whether I’m maintaining IT systems, supporting users, or guiding a student through complex topics, I stay grounded in what works and what actually matters in the real world.
          </p>
            <p>
            I approach cybersecurity as more than a job—it’s a discipline that requires constant learning, critical thinking, and the ability to adapt. I bring that mindset into every environment I work in. I don’t cut corners, and I don’t believe in temporary fixes.
            I build systems that are secure, sustainable, and built to last.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive when I’m solving problems, streamlining operations, and helping others understand the “why” behind the technology they use. 
            I care about making infrastructure stronger, users safer, and teams more effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mission is simple: build, secure, support, and teach—with no shortcuts, no guesswork, and no nonsense.
